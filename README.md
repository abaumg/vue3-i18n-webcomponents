# vue3-i18n-webcomponents

## What is this repo about?

The goal is to create a [Vue3.2-powered Web Component](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3.2.html) (not just a 'normal' custom element) with [vue-i18n-next](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next) support. 

## Requirements

Although `vue-i18n-next` added support for Custom Elements in version [v9.2.0-beta.3](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/releases/tag/v9.2.0-beta.3), an [additional patch](https://github.com/abaumg/vue-i18n-next/tree/feat/webcomponents) is needed for supporting Web Components. 

## TODO

- type error in `src/App.vue::watch()`
